The purpose of this repository is to calculate simulations of profits and losses in annuity producs in the portfolio of a hypothetical insurance company . I teach this business case in my class in Universidad Nacional Autonoma de Mexico (aka UNAM). 
If you want to know all the context, please go to https://sites.google.com/view/aariesgo/p%C3%A1gina-principal. I use SAS/Base, SAS/IML and XML code to implement my examples.
